 *
 * @param s     Starting vertex for the MST (0-based index)

 * @param pred  Output vector that will store the predecessor of each vertex in the MST
 *              (-1 indicates no predecessor/vertex unreachable)
 * @return      The total weight/cost of the MST
 *
 * @note The graph must be undirected and connected (for complete MST)
 * @note Time complexity: O(E log V) with binary heap priority queue
 * @note Space complexity: O(V) for key, pred, and visited storage
 * @note Uses a max-heap priority queue with negative weights for min-heap behavior
 * @note LLINF should be defined as a large constant (e.g., numeric_limits<ll>::max())
